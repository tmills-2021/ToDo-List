## Todo list
This project is intended to test our ability to create lists using React, building out a Todo list which a user can add/remove items from

## Usage
To run this project, clone the repo to your local machine and run `npm start` in your terminal or code editor.  In order to remove a task completely from the list, click twice.

## Future Enhancements
* Color code tasks
* Prioritization of tasks
* Ability to choose between strike-through or remove on initial click
